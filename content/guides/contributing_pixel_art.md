# Contributing Pixel Art

This covers the specifications for pixel art in the game. If you are interested in contributing pixel art, please read this document carefully.

## Static Sprites

Static sprites are the individual images used for characters, objects, and backgrounds in the game. They should be designed to fit within the game's aesthetic and technical requirements.

## Animated Sprites
Animated sprites are sequences of images that create the illusion of movement. These are used for character animations, environmental effects, and other dynamic elements in the game.

### Technical Specifications
- **Dimensions**: Each frame of the animated sprite should be large enough to contain all movement of the character throughout all frames, keeping the character centered at a specific point in all frames for transitioning.
- **Frame Rate**: Animated sprites should be designed to run at 5 frames per second (FPS).
- **File Format**: Save animated sprites as a sprite sheet in Aseprite format (.aseprite). We use an Aseprite importer.
- **Transparency**: Ensure that the background is transparent to allow for seamless integration into the game environment.

## Pixel Art Specifications

- **Resolution**: The pixel art should be created at a resolution of 16x16 pixels.
- **Color Palette**: Use a limited color palette to maintain a consistent aesthetic. The recommended palette is the [DawnBringer 16 Color Palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/dawnbringer-16-color-palette).
- **File Format**: Save the pixel art files in PNG format to preserve transparency and quality.
