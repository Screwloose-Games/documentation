# Review Checklist

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a quick checklist for evaluating the current state of a game. Items on the list are in priority order and are intended to draw attention to important features that developers might want to consider incorporating into the game.

## Checklist

Here’s an ordered checklist for reviewing a game jam game, prioritizing essential aspects for gameplay, player experience, and polish. I've also added a few important items to consider in game jam games.

Here is the list without the bold style:

### Highest Importance (Gameplay and Player Experience)

1. [ ] Mechanics are introduced gradually (close to 1 at a time)
2. [ ] The player has a chance to practice a mechanic in increasing difficulty (requiring more precision) before adding a new mechanic.
3. [ ] Within 15 seconds of where the player has control, the player’s progress in the game is evident through feedback at an interval of no less than 5, 10, 15 seconds.
4. [ ] The camera is regularly positioned so that the player can see what they need to see (including detail and surroundings).
5. [ ] When the player dies, they start right back “where they need to” with only an appropriate amount of effort required to get back where they died.

### High Importance (Core Features and Visual Consistency)

6. [ ] The visual style is consistent between the title screen and the game.
7. [ ] The game has music.
8. [ ] Has a title screen.
9. [ ] The style of the UI thematically matches the game. (ideas: <https://www.gameuidatabase.com/>)
10. [ ] There is a counter that expresses progress.
11. [ ] The player can bring up tutorial info at any time in a codex through pause or other menu.

### Medium Importance (Polish and UX)

13. [ ] There is music on the title screen.

17. [ ] You can pause the game.
18. [ ] Has a sound settings option in the settings menu.

20. [ ] Achievements are tracked.
21. [ ] There is a leaderboard.

### Additional Considerations
