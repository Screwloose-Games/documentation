# UI Concept Sketches and Wireframes Guide

---

**Purpose**:  
This document outlines the process for creating UI concept sketches and wireframes for early-stage game development.

---

## 1. Overview

- **UI Concept Sketches**: Simple, low-fidelity visuals outlining basic UI layout and structure.
- **Wireframes**: More detailed, functional blueprints focused on element placement and user flow, without aesthetics like color or images.

---

## 2. Tools

- **Sketching**: [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), Figma, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, Pen and Paper.
- **Collaboration**: [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
- **Assets**: Use internal style guide and asset libraries.

## 3. UI Concept Sketch Guidelines

1. **Focus on Layout**: Visualize key UI components (menus, HUD, buttons) without detail.
2. **Multiple Variations**: Explore different layout options.
3. **Basic Annotations**: Add simple notes for navigation or interactions.

---

## 4. Wireframe Guidelines

1. **Grid Structure**: Standardize UI layout with consistent spacing and sizing.
2. **Focus on Flow**: Clearly depict user navigation between screens.
3. **Indicate Interactions**: Highlight buttons, inputs, and clickable areas.
4. **Placeholder Text**: Use labels for key elements (e.g., “Main Menu,” “Score”).

## 5. Key UI Components

- **Main Menu**: Title, navigation buttons.
- **In-Game HUD**: Health bars, score, mini-map, action buttons.
- **Pause Menu**: Resume, save, quit buttons.
- **Pop-Ups**: Simple dialog boxes with “OK” or “Cancel.”
- **Settings/Inventory**: Toggles, sliders, grids for items.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Iterate Early**: Share for feedback before moving to high-fidelity designs.
- **Consistency**: Follow established style guides.
- **Focus on Functionality**: Prioritize usability over aesthetics.

---

## 7. File Naming and Version Control

- **Naming**: `UI_[GameName]_[ScreenName]_v[VersionNumber]` (e.g., `UI_FantasyQuest_MainMenu_v1.0`).
- **Storage**: Use shared drives or project systems like GitHub.

---

### 8. Review Process

- **Initial Review**: Submit to Lead UI/UX Designer or Game Director.
- **Team Feedback**: Ensure technical feasibility and usability improvements.
