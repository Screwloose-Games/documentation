# Create rigged 3d humanoid characteres for godot

This requires the use of a 2-legged (bipedal) humanoid character.

## Create / Aquire a 3D model

You can create your own 3D model using Blender or other 3D modeling software, or you can download a pre-made model from the internet.

## Rig the model

Use Mixamo to rig the model. Mixamo is a free online service that allows you to rig 3D models. You can upload your model to Mixamo and it will automatically rig it for you.

## Export the rigged model

Once you have rigged the model, you can export it as an FBX file. Make sure to export the model with the rig.

## Combine all animations into one file

You can use the Character Animation Combiner tool to combine all the animations into one file. This tool allows you to combine multiple animations into one file, which makes it easier to import them into Godot.

## Export GLTF or GLB file

Once you have combined all the animations into one file, you can export the model as a GLTF file. This file format is supported by Godot.

## Import the model into Godot

You can import the model into Godot by dragging and dropping the GLTF file into the Godot editor. Once the model is imported, you can use it in your game.
