# Design Meeting Handoff Process

Engineering lead has a __design review meeting__ with the designer. Input is the design. Output is the technical specifications in tasks.

Typically, the producer will check that this meeting is scheduled, but it is important that the engineering lead and designer take initiative to meet 1:1 regardless.

For engineering, Keep attendees minimal. The primary goal is for the engineering lead to be able to take ownership of the tasks. It may be helpful to have other engineers in attendance. Please just be sure to keep the number of attendees minimal and focused on the engineering lead and designer.

If meeting with producer, do 1:1 instead of having additional engineers, especially if they are talkative .

Share decision flowchart and align on the decisions and steps to occur. Design -> Designer create tasks  -> Eng lead provide feedback, modify the tickets  -> Design review meeting  -> Actionable tasks  -> Lead review with and hand off to engineers.

Align on the overall process expectations. Programmers make tools to allow designers to configure content.
